# Rhymability
This program uses the Carnegie Mellon Rhyming Dictionary (cmudict) to check whether or not two words rhyme. In order to run this program run the main file, RhymingDict.java. I implemented my own linked lists, which can be found in ListInterface.java, MyLinkedList.java, MySortedLinkedList.java, in order to make this program.
